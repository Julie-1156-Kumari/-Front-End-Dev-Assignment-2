        <p>Nature is the endless expanse of life forms, beauty, resources, peace and nourishment. Every bud that grows
            to a flower, every caterpillar that flies with the wings of a butterfly and every infant who faces the world
            as a human, owes its survival and sustenance to nature. In addition to providing resources for our daily
            needs of food, clothing and shelter, nature also contributes to different industries and manufacturing
            units. Paper, furniture, oil, gemstones, petrol, diesel, the fishing industry, electrical units, etc. all
            derive their basic components from nature.
